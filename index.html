<h1>G&C Creations</h1>
  <p> This is a site we have created to display some of the fun we have making and selling our craft items.</p>
     <p>We started making these over the summer to sell at a local craft market that was doing a special event. We were trying to help earn our own spending money for when we go on vacation.</p>
  <p> We will be setup at the Bargersville kids market again this week on Wednesday September 13th. PLease come see us and view our new fall craft products.</p>
